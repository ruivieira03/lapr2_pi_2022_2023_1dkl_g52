# How to lauch demo

This demo only works in console mode.
Run the Main.java file either using an IDE or a console:

```
java Main.java
```

or

```
java src/main/java/pt/ipp/isep/dei/esoft/project/ui/Main.java
```

###### Please note that one of the members couldn't run the application from the console, and we are trying to work on a fix.
###### If you encounter the same error please use an IDE (Intellij works) to run the application.

## Limitations

As we have a missing member since the final two days from this sprint we couldn't finish all his responsibilities on time.

So therefore Branches and Stores are not fully implemented yet.
